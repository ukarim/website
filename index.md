Welcome to my personal website! My name is Karim. I'm software developer based in Almaty.

Here you can find links to my projects, writings, tutorials and etc.

## Projects

- [phone-h323](https://github.com/ukarim/phone-h323) - cross-platform h.323 softphone
  (work in progress)

- [smppgui](https://github.com/ukarim/smppgui) - cross-platform smpp gui client. The idea
  of this tool is not mine. This smpp client was created as a result of an email I received
  from Georgiy (engineer from Kcell VAS operations team).

- [ngx_markdown_filter_module](https://github.com/ukarim/ngx_markdown_filter_module) -
  nginx module for rendering markdown files as html on-the-fly. I've written this module
  in order to use it for this website. But now I just pre-compile markdown files and serve
  them as plain html files.

- [smscsim](https://github.com/ukarim/smscsim) - lightweight smpp smsc simulator. I began
  this project when I was working on the http sms gateway. There were a bunch of other smpp
  smsc simulators, but none of them provided a simple interface to generate MO-sms traffic.
  So I decided to create this program.
